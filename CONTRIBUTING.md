## Getting Started
### Branching Strategy
`main` is the latest stable branch that can be deployed on production workloads.

To work on a new feature or bugfix:
1. Create a new branch, say `add-new-icons` from `main`.
2. Make changes to files in `add-new-icons` branch, commit regularly and push the changes to remote.
3. When the task is complete, create a pull request to merge your changes from `add-new-icons` to `main`. 
4. Request feedback from other collaborators on the pull request and incorporate changes if any.
5. Once the review cycle is over, merge the pull request using a **merge-commit**.
6. After successful merge, delete branch `add-new-icons`.

### Style Guides
This project uses Python linter to ensure the code style is uniform and conforms to a well known syntactical style. [Pylint analyser](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/)
