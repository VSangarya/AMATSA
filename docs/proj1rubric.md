|Chat channel: exists|3|[WhatsApp](Screenshot%202022-10-09%20at%2017.43.53.png)|
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|3|Bugs reported: Issue 27, 35, 10|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files|3|[dev environment setup](https://github.com/VSangarya/AMATSA#--developer-environment-setup), .vscode [dir](https://github.com/VSangarya/AMATSA/blob/main/.vscode/settings.json) for style configuration|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|2|Tools/Style and Style checkers were setup as the first commit. All devs pulled these settings. Hence, no further changes were made.|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|3|Code is deployed on every developer's PC|
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base|3|Every dev has worked on writing code, tests, documentation. Evidence in commits.|
|Short release cycles (hard to see in short projects) project members are committing often enough so that everyone can get your work|3|[Git branching strategy](https://github.com/VSangarya/AMATSA/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#branching-strategy) and frequent [pull-requests](https://github.com/VSangarya/AMATSA/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)|
