|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|---|---|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|3|[README.md](https://github.com/VSangarya/AMATSA#-amatsa)|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|---|---|
|Use of version control tools|3|Git Version Control|
|Use of style checkers|3|Configured [pylintrc](https://github.com/VSangarya/AMATSA/blob/main/pylintrc) with Google's Python style-guide|
|Use of code formatters.|3|.vscode [dir](https://github.com/VSangarya/AMATSA/blob/main/.vscode/settings.json) with formatter settings used by every dev|
|Use of syntax checkers.|3| pylint runs on every pull request to check this.|
|Use of code coverage |3|Coverage reports are generated in [build](https://github.com/VSangarya/AMATSA/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml) GitHub Action|
|Other automated analysis tools|3|[Codacy](https://app.codacy.com/gh/VSangarya/AMATSA/dashboard?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=VSangarya/AMATSA&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade) for static code analysis|
|Test cases exist|3|Tests are written using Pytest [here](https://github.com/VSangarya/AMATSA/tree/main/tests).|
|Test cases are routinely executed|3|Tests are run every pull request by GitHub Actions|
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up|3|Info on style guide, branching strategies, how to raise a PR etc.|

|Chat channel: exists|3|[WhatsApp](Screenshot%202022-10-09%20at%2017.43.53.png)|
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|3|Bugs reported: Issue 27, 35, 10|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files|3|[dev environment setup](https://github.com/VSangarya/AMATSA#--developer-environment-setup), .vscode [dir](https://github.com/VSangarya/AMATSA/blob/main/.vscode/settings.json) for style configuration|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|2|Tools/Style and Style checkers were setup as the first commit. All devs pulled these settings. Hence, no further changes were made.|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|3|Code is deployed on every developer's PC|
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base|3|Every dev has worked on writing code, tests, documentation. Evidence in commits.|
|Short release cycles (hard to see in short projects) project members are committing often enough so that everyone can get your work|3|[Git branching strategy](https://github.com/VSangarya/AMATSA/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#branching-strategy) and frequent [pull-requests](https://github.com/VSangarya/AMATSA/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)|
