### Setup Elasticsearch + Kibana
Elasticsearch and Kibana is easy to setup on any OS platorm - Linux, Darwin or Windows. Our project uses v8.4 for both Elasticsearch and Kibana.
We setup both Elasticsearch and Kibana on a Ubuntu 22.04 LTS VM with the following specifications:
* CPU: 2vCPU
* RAM: 2GB
* Disk: 60GB

1. Refer instructions to [install](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.4/install-elasticsearch.html) Elasticsearch.
2. Refer instructions to [install](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/install.html) Kibana.

If you want to skip the official documentation and quickly get hands-on, simply follow [this](https://std.rocks/gnulinux_siem_01_install_v8.html) for a quick setup!

### Create Index, Roles and Users
1. Access Kibana from your browser at https://<ip-address:port-number> and login with the built-in account `elastic`. Navigate to Management and then Dev Tools.
2. Create index *amatsa*
`PUT /amatsa`
2. Create roles to access the index:<br/>
a. **admin**: This role has full access to index `amatsa` and kibana<br/>
b. **analyst**: This role has read access to index `amatsa` and kibana<br/>
c. **agent**: This role has write access to index `amatsa`<br/>
```
