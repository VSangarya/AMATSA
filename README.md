Have you ever reported to your organization's IT team that your machine is slow or running out of disk space? Well, I guess most of us have done this at some point. What if your IT team can be proactive and give you a new disk (or a new asset to meet your workload!) before you even go to them?

Asset Monitoring and Analytics Tool for sysadmins (we call it AMATSA) is a client-based solution for system administrators to monitor assets in their organization. amatsa-client is cross-platform (Linux, Windows, macOS), can be installed on a server/user PC and takes less than 50MB of disk space at runtime. Once you install the amatsa-client on a host, it will periodically send system metrics (asset info, cpu/memory utilization, network etc.) to the backend server. The backend server runs on Elasticsearch and can be hosted on-premise or in the cloud. Sysadmins can then import our [pre-built](data/kibana/dashboard.ndjson) Kibana dashboard or build custom visualization on top of raw data sent by the clients.

## üìñ Usecases
*  Gather asset information - how many assets are there in the organization, specification of each asset etc.
*  Monitor assets that haven't rebooted in a while to apply security patches.
*  Monitor assets that have high CPU/memory utilization over time.
*  Monitor assets running out of disk space.
*  Monitor network speed of assets across the organization.

## üõ† Installation
*  See [server installation](INSTALL.md#-server) instructions to setup Elasticsearch and Kibana.
*  See [client installation](INSTALL.md#-client) instructions to deploy amatsa-client on assets.
*  Once the server and the clients are setup, you can import and explore our pre-built Kibana dashboards.

## üë©üèº‚Äçüíª üöÄ Developer Environment Setup
### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.10+
2. VS Code (to make collaboration easier. We don't want to argue over tabs vs spaces!)
### Setup
1. Spawn terminal and change working directory to repo directory.

2. Create virtual environment using venv: `path/to/python -m venv .venv`

3. Activate virtual environment:<br/>
Linux/MacOS:  `source .venv/bin/activate`<br/>
Windows:  `source .venv/Scripts/activate`<br/>

4. Install Python dependencies
```Text
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

## ‚Üë Enhancements
### Server
*  Send emails to users based on occurrence of an event.

### Client
*  Collect running process information (name, pid) to identify unique instances across your organization.
*  Monitor listening ports across assets to identify which services are listening in your network.
*  Configure a rule file containing filenames to monitor on the client. If the hash of monitored file changes, you can send an event.
